/*  Including script component

    This is the first include of the script component in this file series. Any file also included after this
    will also have that script_component.hpp in it. Think of #include as a copy paste. You do not need to include
    this file if your file is included after.

/*
    So all 3 of these files will be copy and pasted here, so essentially, think of this as one really big file
