/*  script_component, inside of functions folder

    The reason we also create a script_component here, is so that in each function file, we only need to include the following:

    #include "script_component.hpp"

    Instead of having to put the full file name. This also lets you use customized script_component(s) from each addon.

#include "\x\MyMod\addons\main\script_component.hpp"
